# migration-java8-java21
Migrate Java 8 services to Java 21 and beyond. This repo is a refactoring toolkit that would help you do so quickly, correctly, and effectively.
The code is under testing and is only for my personal use. Please send me an email <surajkrajan95@gmail.com> and i will share the code with you for free. I can also help you personally with the migration and offer help with migration strategies.
